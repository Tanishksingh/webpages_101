            The predecessor to Burger NET was founded in 1953 in Bijnor,Uttar Pradesh, as Insta-Burger NET. After visiting the McDonald brothers' original store location in  Lucknow, the founders and owners (Soumya Chaudhary and his brother Siddharth Chaudhary), who had purchased the rights to two pieces of equipment called "Insta-machines", opened their first restaurants. Their production model was based on one of the machines they had acquired, an oven called the "Insta-Broiler". This strategy proved to be so successful that they later required all of their franchises to use the device.After the company faltered in 1959, it was purchased by its Kanpur, franchisees. They initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain, first renaming the company Burger NET. They ran the company as an independent entity for eight years (eventually expanding to over 250 locations in India).
